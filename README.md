# BetterLootMarkers - Cyberpunk 2077 mod

![Screenshot](screenshot.png "BetterLootMarkers Mod")
This is a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that adds detailed loot markers on looting containers and dropped loot.

If a container contains items of different types (armor, weapon, eddies), an icon for each category will show instead of the default loot marker, with different colored icons to represent the highest quality loot in each category.

## Installation
This mod requires [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks) Version 1.18.1+ (also on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107)) to be installed.

Extract the entire repository into `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\` and run the game.

[Optional] Set "Vertical Mode" to true in the Cyber Engine Tweaks overlay to change the display mode of the markers to vertical

Tested to work on Cyberpunk version 1.63
